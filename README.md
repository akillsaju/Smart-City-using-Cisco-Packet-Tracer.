# Smart-City-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer.

**Aim**

To design and simulate a Smart City environment in Cisco Packet Tracer with smart surveillance, intelligent street lighting, and fire monitoring.

**Problem statement**

Cities need automated monitoring systems for safety and efficiency. This project simulates a Smart City in Cisco Packet Tracer with surveillance, smart lighting, and fire detection.

**Scope**

* Demonstrates IoT-based automation using Packet Tracer.
* Shows real-world hardware possibility with TinkerCad circuit.
* Focuses on three aspects: security, energy saving, and fire safety.

**Required components**

**Software**

**Software:** Cisco Packet Tracer, TinkerCad, Arduino IDE.
**Hardware (for TinkerCad simulation): **Arduino UNO, LDR, PIR sensor, MQ-2 gas sensor, LED, Buzzer, Resistors, Breadboard, Wires.
